# Core Java Notes

During learning Java, I adhered to the principle of "code more".
Theoretical material tends to be forgotten. These circumstances
got me to practice with almost all aspects of Horstmann's book
"Core Java" (both values).

This project has a book hierarchy. Each chapter in fact consists of
some amount of subprojects, e.g. there are lots of custom
collections:
[Heap](https://github.com/druyaned/core-java-notes/tree/main/src/main/java/druyaned/corejava/vol1/ch09/src/heap),
[Red-Black-Tree](https://github.com/druyaned/core-java-notes/tree/main/src/main/java/druyaned/corejava/vol1/ch09/src/rbt)
and some others.
Among other things
[Calculator](https://github.com/druyaned/core-java-notes/tree/main/src/main/java/druyaned/corejava/vol1/ch12/src/calc)
or
[Mail Sender](https://github.com/druyaned/core-java-notes/blob/main/src/main/java/druyaned/corejava/vol2/ch04/src/P06Mail.java)
can be found here.
